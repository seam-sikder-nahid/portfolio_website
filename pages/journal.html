                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        Looking back at the past year, I'm amazed at how far we've come. Starting a startup 
                        while working as a security consultant was challenging, but it taught me invaluable 
                        lessons about time management, prioritization, and resilience.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                        The biggest lesson? Building something people actually want is harder than building 
                        something technically impressive. I've pivoted the product three times based on customer 
                        feedback, and each iteration brought us closer to product-market fit. The technical 
                        challenges were the easy part – understanding customer pain points and translating 
                        them into features was the real work.

                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        Spent the weekend mentoring aspiring cybersecurity professionals at a local bootcamp. 
                        It reminded me of my own journey and how crucial mentorship was in my early career. 
                        Seeing their enthusiasm and hunger to learn recharged my own passion for this field.

                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                        One student asked me about imposter syndrome – something I still struggle with despite 
                        the achievements. I told them what helped me: focus on continuous learning, celebrate 
                        small wins, and remember that everyone starts somewhere. The goal isn't to know 
                        everything; it's to never stop learning.

                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        As I transition more into the entrepreneurial side, I find myself grappling with a 
                        common dilemma: how deep to go technically versus how much to focus on business. 
                        I love diving deep into code and security research, but building a successful company 
                        requires strategic thinking, sales, and leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                        My current approach: maintain technical credibility by staying hands-on with key 
                        technical decisions and architecture, while delegating day-to-day implementation. 
                        It's not perfect, but it allows me to contribute where I add the most value while 
                        building business skills.

                    <h3 class="card-title">The Value of Failure</h3>
                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        This week marked the anniversary of a major failure – a security tool I built that 
                        completely flopped. I spent six months building it, launched it with high expectations, 
                        and got... crickets. Zero users, zero traction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                        At the time, it felt devastating. Looking back, it was one of the most valuable 
                        learning experiences. It taught me about market research, the importance of talking 
                        to users early, and the difference between a cool technical project and a viable product. 
                        Those lessons directly informed how I'm building SecureShield today.
